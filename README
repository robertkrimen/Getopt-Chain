VERSION
    Version 0.015

SYNPOSIS
        package My::Command;

        use Getopt::Chain::Declare;

                                 # my-command --verbose initialize ...

        # my-command ? initialize ... --> my-command help initialize ...
        rewrite qr/^\?(.*)/ => sub { "help ".($1||'') };

        # NOTE: Rewriting applies to the command sequence, NOT options

        # my-command about ... --> my-command help about
        rewrite [ ['about', 'copying'] ] => sub { "help $1" };

            # Do help stuff ...
            # First argument is undef because help
            # doesn't take any options
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Getopt::Chain can be used to provide svn(1)- and git(1)-style option and
    command processing. Any option specification covered by Getopt::Long is
    fair game.

    This is a new version of Getopt::Chain that uses Path::Dispatcher

    CAVEAT 1: This is pretty beta, so the sugar/interface above WILL be
    tweaked

    CAVEAT 2: Unfortunately, Getopt::Long slurps up the entire arguments
    array at once. Usually, this isn't a problem (as Getopt::Chain uses
    pass_through). However, if a subcommand has an option with the same name
    or alias as an option for a parent, then that option won't be available
    for the subcommand. For example:

        ./script --verbose --revision 36 edit --revision 48 --file xyzzy.c
        # Getopt::Chain will not associate the second --revision with "edit"

    So, for now, try to use distinct option names/aliases :)

    DEBUG: You can get some extra information about what Getopt::Chain is
    doing by setting the environment variable "GOC_TRACE" to 1

LEGACY
    The old-style, non Path::Dispatcher version is still available at
    Getopt::Chain::v005
